# 2023-AI-Final-Project

## Main Idea

This project is designed to assist users in organizing their day effectively. With just a few inputs of their task and corresponding deadline, the tool automatically schedules the activity for them. It simplifies the scheduling process, allowing users to focus on the task at hand rather than worrying about managing their time.

## Implementation Method

We are considering utilizing a variable-based model to represent the situation at hand, along with implementing the Q-learning algorithm for training purposes. This approach will enable us to create a flexible and adaptable model that can learn from experience and improve over time
